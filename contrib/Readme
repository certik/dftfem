The "archives" dir contains versions of packages which are tested with this
project. They were downloaded using the "downloadpackages" script at that time.

Build all the packages in this order:

./buildarpack
./buildpetsc
./buildslepc
./buildlibmesh

They will be installed in the "libs" directory. "Clean" script deletes this
directory.
