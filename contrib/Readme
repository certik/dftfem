Because the installation of the contrib packages can be a little tricky, we
wrote some scripts to compile them automatically.  The "archives" dir contains
versions of packages which are tested with this project. They were downloaded
using the "downloadpackages" script at that time.

Build all the packages using:

./make

They will be installed in the "libs" directory. Clean everything using:

./clean
